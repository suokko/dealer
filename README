This program is hereby put in the public domain. Do with it whatever
you want, but I would like you not to redistribute it in modified form
without mentioning the fact of modification. I will accept bug reports
and modification requests, without any obligation of course, but fixing
bugs someone else put in is beyond me.

When you report bugs please mention the version number in the source
files, and preferably send context diffs if you changed anything.
I might put in your fixes, and distribute a new version someday.

I would prefer if you did *not* use this program for generating hands
for tournaments. I have not investigated the random number generation
closely enough for me to be comfortable with that thought.

1. Dependencies

Recommended tools to build from source are
* lcov

Recommended run time dependencies are
* Bo's dds (http://privat.bahnhof.se/wb758135/)

libdds.so, libdds.dylib or dds.dll needs to be in runtime library search path to
use double dummy solver in dealer scripts.

2.  Build on linux:


 ./configure
 make
 make install

Running configure is not required but it is helpful if you want to customize
install paths or use custom compiler or flags.

If you want to use nondefault compiler options they can be passed with CPPFLAGS
make variable. CFLAGS or CXXFLAGS works too but that won't override -march=native.

You can also run the dealer from source directory.

3. Build on MAC OS

Notes (Old notes not tested after build system changes):

    make CPPFLAGS = -g -O0 -no-pedantic -DFRANCOIS
