# This an input file to test dealer.  It generates a million hands without
# any constraints, then prints the frequency of the various suit lengths
# and hcp holdings.  The output can be piped into a perl-script to compare
# it against the theoretical holdings.  It should give a quick check if
# the deals you are producing are sort-of random.
