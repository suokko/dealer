<P> 
This program is hereby put in the public domain. Do with it whatever you
want, but I would like you not to redistribute it in modified form without
mentioning the fact of modification. I will accept bug reports and
modification requests, without any obligation of course, but fixing bugs
someone else put in is beyond me.

<P> 
When you report bugs please mention the version number in the source
files, and preferably send context diffs if you changed anything. I might
put in your fixes, and distribute a new version someday.

<P>
I would prefer if you did *not* use this program for generating hands for
tournaments. I have not investigated the random number generation closely
enough for me to be comfortable with that thought.

<P>
(Note: random number generation has been significantly improved since the
original release, for which this disclaimer was written; check the source
code for more details).
