<h1>DEALER, a bridge hand generator program</h1>
</center>

<h2>Description</h2>
The program <font color=red>dealer</font> can be used to generate hands for
partnerships bidding training or for generating statistics that can be used to
design conventions, or win postmortems.

<P>
Running the program involves 3 steps.  First, the user has to write
an input file containing hand-descriptions and action. 
A very simple example would look something like:
A simple example:
<font color=navy size=-1>
<blockquote>
condition shape(north, any 4333 + any 4423) and hcp(north)>=19<BR>
action printall
</blockquote>
</font>
The first 2 lines specify a condition for the north hand, in this case,
a hand with 4333 or 4432 shape and at least 19 high card points.  The
last 2 lines tell the program to print the 4 hands.  The program reads
from standard input, so in principle, it is possible to enter the
conditions directly into the program.  Using a file is a lot more
practical though, as it allows the user to re-use conditions and
fine-tune the conditions.

<P>
Then the program has to be run, it reads the file, looks at the
various <A HREF="command.html">command line switches</A>
 and then produces a number of hands.
The output appears on the screen but can be re-directed to a file.

<P> 
Finally, the user has to look at output and analyze the produced
hands.  Alternatively, the output can be used for a playing program.
