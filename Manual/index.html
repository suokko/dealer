<h1>DEALER, a bridge hand generator program</h1>
</center>

<h2>Description</h2>
The program <font color=red>dealer</font> can be used to generate hands
for partnerships bidding training or for generating statistics that can be
used to design conventions, or win postmortems.

<P>
Running the program involves 3 steps.  First, the user has to write an
input file containing hand-descriptions and action.  A very simple example
would look something like:
<font color=navy size=-1>
<blockquote>
condition shape(north, any 4333 + any 4423) and hcp(north)>=19<BR>
action printall
</blockquote>
</font>
The first 2 lines specify a condition for the north hand, in this case, a
hand with 4333 or 4432 shape and at least 19 high card points.  The last 2
lines tell the program to print the 4 hands.  The program reads from
standard input, so in principle, it is possible to enter the conditions
directly into the program.  Using a file is a lot more practical though,
as it allows the user to re-use conditions and fine-tune the conditions.

<P>
Then the program has to be run, it reads the file, looks at the various <A
HREF="command.html">command line switches</A> and then produces a number
of hands. The output appears on the screen but can be re-directed to a
file.

<P> 
Finally, the user has to look at output and analyze the produced hands.  
Alternatively, the output can be used for a playing program.

<H2>Warning</H2>
Dealer is meant for relatively complex use. If you just want to deal hands
for a tournament Hans has written totally different code. You can find it at
<A HREF="http://www.xs4all.nl/~sater">www.xs4all.nl/~sater</A>.
If you use other programs now to deal hands for tournaments please read the
documentation of Big Deal. You will be convinced and switch.
