<h1>
Pre-Processors</h1>
The pre-processor directory contains code that can be used to generate
input for dealer. Currently there is only 1 contribution, <b>DPP</b> by
Francois Dellacherie.

<h3>
1. What is dpp ?</h3>
dpp stands for dealer-pre-processor. Its main purpose is to preprocess
input files for Hans van Staveren's great dealer program.
<h3>
2. How is it written ?</h3>
dpp is written in Perl-object. In fact, it was a small part of a package
that I will probably never finish to write (a package that should do automatic
checking of bidding conventions...).
<p>It contains two file:
<ul>
<li>
the executable file 'dpp',</li>

<li>
the package 'Dist.pm'.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
3. What do I need to make it work ?</h3>

<ul>
<li>
You need Perl (and anyway, even if you don't plan to use dpp, you probably
need perl, with or without knowing it !),</li>

<li>
You may need to change the first line of dpp, depending on where your perl
interpreter is located, and where you plan to install the package file
'Dist.pm'.</li>

<li>
You need to read this...</li>
</ul>

<h3>
4. What can I do with it ?</h3>
The greatest idea of Hans van Staveren was his 'shape' function (please
reread his manual). The 'shape' function speed is the same for any number
of args in it. Unfortunately, there's no convenient way to express ideas
like "a balanced shape with 4 in a major". With the regular dealer, you
have to write :
<pre>shape(north,2443 + 2434 + 3424 + 3442 + 3433 + 4243 + 4423 + 4234 +
                 4432 + 4324 + 4342 + 4333)</pre>
or, if you are clever :
<pre>shape(north, any 4432 + any 4333 - 3343 - 3334 - 2344 - 3244)</pre>
With dpp, you will just write :
<pre>shape{north, 4M(3+3+2+)}</pre>
nice isn't it ??

<h3>5. Differences with the original syntax of shape:</h3>
Perl is great. (Repeat after me...)
<p>The only thing it misses regarding text-parsing is the hability to handle
sexp (in a more general case, I don't recommend having sex-p with a computer
;-). The bad news is that I had to change the parenthesis () into braces
{}, because I wanted to use () for other purposes inside the shape-func.
The only other difference is that shape doesn't recognize the word 'any'
anymore.
<p>(I confess I may have kept the old syntax and invent a new word like
dist{}. If people complain about this, I may change it... I just wanted
to keep HVS-soul alive in my files...)
<p>The new general syntax is :
<pre>shape{COMPASS, shp1 + shp2 + ... + shpM - shm1 - ... - shmN}</pre>
See below for the atomic (shp or shm) shapes...
<h3>
6. Features:</h3>
when you see a shape after a &raquo; signs, it's the result of a shape
after being dp-processed...
<ol>
<li>
regular shapes : 7xxx, 4432, 4xx5 have the same meaning as in original
dealer.

<li>
the 'at least' operator : whenever you put a '+' after a suit-length, it
means 'at least'.</li>
<p>Example: shape{north, 5+xx5+} : at least 5/5 in the blacks, &raquo;shape(north,5xx5
+ 5xx6 + 6xx5 + 5xx7 + 6xx6 + 7xx5 + 5008 + 6007 + 7006 + 8005)
<li>
the 'at most' operator : same as the 'at least', just use a '-' :
<p>Example: shape{north, 2-xxx} : at most 2 spades, &raquo;shape(north,0xxx
+ 1xxx + 2xxx)
<li>
the 'range' operator : the range operator operates on a single suit. It
comes with [], like in Perl.

<p>Example: shape{north, x[3-5]x[13]} : (3 to 5) hearts, and one or 3 clubs
&raquo;shape(north,x3x1 + x4x1 + x3x3 + x5x1 + x4x3 + x5x3)
<p>Note that shape{north, 3-xxx} is equivalent to shape{north,[0-3]xxx}
You can write compound ranges if you want : shape{north, [013-68]xxx} means:
0,1,3,4,5,6 or 8 spades.
<li>
the 'permutation' operator : the permutation operator will appears as ()
like in the WBF rules of specifying shapes. Example :
<p>shape{north, (4432)} : any 4432 hand. &raquo;shape(north,any 4432)
<p>what's best is that the () operator can operate on restricted groups
of cards :
<p>Example: shape{north, 5s(431)} : 5 spades, the others suits being (431).
&raquo;shape(north,5134 + 5314 + 5143 + 5341 + 5413 + 5431)
<p>What you have to do is :
<ul>
<li>
specify the suit names (s,h,d,c in english) in the left part of the shape,
in any order,
<li>
and enclose the rest of the permutation into () in the right part.</li>
</ul>
A (complicated) example : shape{north, 4+c3+d(2+2+)} : at least 5 clubs,
at least 3 diamonds, and no short major. &raquo;shape(north,3334 +
4234 + 2434 + 3244 + 2344 + 2254 + 3235 + 2335 + 2245 + 2236)
<li>
the 'Major' operator : has to be used together with the () operator. 'M'
stands for 'a major' The 'M' operator can only be used in the left part
(never put a M inside the parens)
<p>Examples :
<br>shape{north, 5M(xxx)} &raquo;shape(north,x5xx + 5xxx)
<br>shape{north, 5+M3+c(31)} &raquo;shape(north,1534 + 3514 + 1633
+ 3613 + 5134 + 5314 + 6133 + 6313)
<li>
the 'minor' operator : same as the 'Major' operator, but in lowercase 'm'.
<p>Example : shape{north, 5M5m(xx)} &raquo;shape(north,x5x5 + 5xx5
+ x55x + 5x5x)
<li>
the 'conditional' operator : you've got the possibility of specifying complex
conditions to be verified that cannot be simply expressed by other operators.
In order to do that, you use the ':' operator, just after the atomic-shape
specification : shape{north, shp1:condition1,condition2,...}
<p>The conditions use the letters (s,h,d,c) as variables for the suit lengths,
and the usual C-operators (*,+,-,/,>,&lt;,==,!,?, and so on) Note that
the ',' stands for the 'and-logical' operator. You can use 'or' for the
'or-logical' operator.
<p>Example: shape{north, 4+s4+h(xx):d>c,h+s==10} &raquo;shape(north,6421
+ 6430 + 5521 + 5530 + 4621 + 4630)</ol>

<h3>
7. Some other examples:</h3>

<ul>
<li>
A balanced hand : (3+3+3+2+)</li>

<li>
A french 1H opening : x5+xx:h>s,h>=d,h>=c</li>

<li>
a michaels (spade+minor) : 5+s5+m(xx)</li>

<li>
my No_trump opening :</li>

<br>hn = hcp(north)
<br>n1NT = (hn > 14 and hn &lt; 18 and shape{north, 5m(332) + 5m2s(42)}
) or
<br>(hn > 13 and hn &lt; 17 and shape{north, 6m(322)} ) or
<br>(hn > 15 and hn &lt; 18 and shape{north, 5M(332)} ) or
<br>(hn > 15 and hn &lt; 19 and shape{north, (4432) + (4333)} )</ul>

<h3>
8. How to use dpp:</h3>

<ol>
<li>
Unix world: dpp my_input_file | dealer</li>

<li>
Windows/DOS world: I don't know. I've never used windows/DOS in my life
:-). I guess 2 possibilities :</li>

<ol>
<li>
'dpp my_input_file > dppfile' followed by 'dealer dppfile'</li>

<li>
Include the dpp code inside the dealer code. Maybe somebody can do that
on the next dealer distribution, and add a '-dpp' option to dealer. I won't
do it, since I cannot check if that works properly.</li>
</ol>

<li>
you can also try some shapes by typing 'dpp' on the command line, and enter
shape{} one by one to see how it transforms them.</li>
</ol>

<h3>
9. Languages:</h3>
The suit specifications can be made in french or english. The default mode
is english. To change the mode, you can do 2 things:
<ul>
<li>
add a "Dist->language('French');" in dpp (after the Dist->new)</li>

<li>
Change the DefaultLanguage value in Dist.pm</li>
</ul>
If somebody wants to add other languages, it's possible...
<h3>
10. Bugs and further developments:</h3>
If you :
<ul>
<li>
notice bugs or,</li>

<li>
don't understand a peculiar behaviour of dpp (but please reread this README
first),</li>

<li>
have suggestions for further developments,</li>
</ul>
you can e-mail me at
<a href="mailto:sr007-2@dial.oleane.com">sr007-2@dial.oleane.com</a>
<p>On the other hand, if you :
<ul>
<li>
don't understand the *code*,</li>

<li>
cannot install perl on your machine,</li>
</ul>
there is unfortunately nothing that I can do for you.
<p>Quoting Hans van Staveren :
<blockquote>
<font color="blue">
This program is hereby put in the public domain. Do with it
whatever you want, but I would like you not to redistribute it in modified
form without mentioning the fact of modification. I will accept bug reports
and modification requests, without any obligation of course, but fixing
bugs someone else put in is beyond me.
<p>When you report bugs please mention the version number in the source
files, and preferably send context diffs if you changed anything. I might
put in your fixes, and ask Henk to distribute a new version someday.
</font></blockquote>
Have Fun!
