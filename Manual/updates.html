 <LI> <B>April 22, 1999 (HU):</B> Clean-up of the code, reduced the number
                                  of warnings on compilation from 3 screens,
                                  to half a page.

                                  manual updates from Alex Martelli, 
                                  more fixes for MSDOS by Paul Baxter.
 <LI> <B>July   1, 1999 (HU):</B> 
  <UL>

   <LI> Macros instead of function calls whenever possible. 
   <LI> Preprocessor code from Francois.  
   <LI> Better code for calculating HCP (etc.) from Danil. 
   <LI> Updates for defs.y from Danil.

  </UL>
 <LI> <B>July   5, 1999 (AM):</B> 
  <UL>  
   <LI> Key issue: a line (the body of a while loop!) had mysteriously disappeared
        from defs.y, causing several problems with printes/printoneline
   <LI> Lesser issue: a long-standing syntax glitch caused all input of the form
        "-" followed by a digit to be interpreted as a single token, thus
        mandating a separating spaces in non-obvious places, e.g.:
        "spades(south)-2" would be an error, "spades(south)- 2" correct.
        I fixed that by removing from scan.l the lexical production for negative
        number and adding "ARMINUS NUMBER" to defs.y for nonterminal
        "number"; shift/reduce conflicts go up from 9 to 16 but I don't think that
        breaks anything (I'm not sure how to test for this specifically).
   <LI> Sundry stuff: some clarifications & error fixes in the manual HTML files.
  </UL>
 <LI> <B>July   7, 1999 (DS):</B> Macro for hascard() and interesting() to
        reduce the number of ifdef's.
 <LI> <B>July  13, 1999 (HU):</B> Review of manual.
 <LI> <B>August  3, 1999 (HU):</B> Included defs.c in the distribution (for 
                                   people that don't have yacc on their machine).
                                   Removed libgnurand.a from the distribution, 
                                   the binary doesn't belong in there.
                                   Added a few comments about compiling to the manual.
 <LI> <B>August 21, 1999 (HU):</B> Check range for -s value, rotate dealer in 
                                   pbn output, suggestions from
                                   Alan Jaffray (jaffray@pobox.com).
                                   Print board number in printall output,
                                   suggested by Thorvald Aagaard 
                                   (aagaard@webtrade.dk).
