<h1>Downloading and installation</h1>

Click <a href="ftp:dealer.tar.gz">here</a> to download the code.  This is
a so-called gzipped tar file.  To install the program on any Unix
platform, do:
<ul>
 <li> gzip -dc dealer.tar.gz | tar xvf -
 <li> cd dealer
 <li> make
</ul>
And you should end up with the <font color=red>dealer</font> executable in
your current working directory.  Then test the program with
<ul>
 <li> cd Examples
 <li> make test 
</ul>
This will process all examples in the Examples directory, store the 
output for visual inspection and compare the output against a reference
copy of the output.  The output from the test typically starts with:
<FONT COLOR="blue">
<PRE>
test_dealer.pl
------------------------------------------------------------------
Now processing Descr.6c
Done, output in Output.6c
Comparing against reference output from Refer.6c
6c6
< Time needed  25.55 sec
---
> Time needed  12.99 sec
<I>...And so on for other examples...</I>
</PRE>
</FONT>
The example that was run was "Descr.6c", output of this example 
can be found in "Output.6c".  Comparing the output against the reference
output showed 1 difference: the CPU time that was needed to process the 
input file.  The example took 25.55s when it was just run, the machine
where the reference copy was produced needed only 12.99 seconds.

<P>
This particular difference is, of course, harmless, as the CPU time needed
to process an example varies from computer to computer.  Other differences
that can be safely ignored are the dates in the PBN example.  However, if the
program had crashed on this example, the output from the test had started with:
<FONT COLOR="blue">

and it would be time to start debugging.
<P>
The exhaust mode is still under development. By default, it is switched
off. To include the code, edit the Makefile and change the line:
<ul>
 <li> CFLAGS= (...) -DNDEBUG 
</ul>
into
<ul>
 <li> CFLAGS= (...) -DNDEBUG -DFRANCOIS
</ul>

<h2>Problems when compiling</H2>

<UL>
 <LI> Not all versions of make support the -C flag.  If this happens on your
      system, edit the Makefile and replace all lines:
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
  ${MAKE} -C <i>directory</i> <i>action</i>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  by
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
  cd <i>directory</i> ; make <i>action</i>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
 <LI> Mike Zimmermann  <zimmy@nc.rr.com> reported that on MAC OS X (aka Darwin), the
      line CFLAGS has to be:
      <ul>
       <li> CFLAGS= -g -DNDEBUG -DFRANCOIS -I.
      </ul>

</UL>

<h1>Portability</H1>

The program has been developed under SunOS on Sun hardware. I (Hans) am a
reasonably competent programmer though, and I expect the program to be
highly portable. The most suspect part is in the initialisation of the
random number generator. The system call used here might need to be
changed on other OSes.

<p> 
There has been a DOS and OS/2 port by Pedl Rau. I tested the speed at
about 9000 hands a second on my 486DX33.  <b>Note:</b> this has been
superseeded by the work from (a.o.) Paul Baxter, Alex Martelli and Danil
Suits.  

<P>
Henk Uijterwaal has compiled his version under Linux (2.0.x and 2.2.x)
without any problem, except that one needed to do:
<blockquote>
<font size=-1>
   ln -s /usr/bin/flex /usr/bin/lex
</font></blockquote>
as flex has succeeded lex on Linux.  On Ultrix, DEC Alpha(OSF), BSDI/3.x
and SGI, the program compiled without any problem.

<P>
A. Martelli <A HREF="mailto:alex@magenta.com">(alex@magenta.com)</A> used
to build and run Dealer on Win/NT and Win/98 with the free Cygwin GCC
C/C++ compiler and Unix emulation environment. Main changes needed were
byacc instead of yacc, as well as flex instead of lex, in the Makefile. A
Makefile with all these changes is available in the MSDOS subdirectory.

<P>
Dealer's latest versions build and run fine using Microsoft Visual Studio
5 and 6 (still using byacc and flex if needed for syntax mods, but with no
other known dependency on Cygwin); there is a current dependency on the
Winsock2 DLL (for ntohs, ntohl functions) soon to be removed.
